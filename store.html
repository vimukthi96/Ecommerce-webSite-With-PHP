				<h1>About Divine Cell Care</h1>

				<p>We, Divine Cell Care, are a company established as a highly distinguished and recognized supplier in the cellular communications industry. Our goal to become the leading distributor of wireless communications services through out the City of Colombo has now become a reality.</p>

				<p>With fully equipped showrooms in the leading shopping malls in Colombo, Divine Cell Care has identified the emerging trends and built them into our company’s operations. Our capacity to respond fast to technology changes and being there on time, providing high-quality customer services, investing in the right resources, expanding into specialty markets, and staying ahead of the "technology curve" has been the keys to our success.</p>

				<p>The company was initially formed as a sole proprietorship by Mr. Gihan Nadeera Subhasinghe, in Decemeber 2007 in Majestic City shopping-mall which is considered the most affluent and high-end shopping complex in Colombo city. From there on we have succeeded tremendously in that market. Taking advantage on the growing wireless communications industry and based on our success in the first showroom, we decided to expand our company's operations to two more showrooms in the same shopping-mall and another showroom in Crescat Boulevard in Colombo.</p>

				<p>In Sri Lanka, the Cellular Telephones have revolutionized the communications arena, redefining how we perceive voice communications and fast massaging. Traditionally, cellular phones remained out of the hands of most consumers due to their high cost. But today cellular phones are truly consumer electronics devices.</p>

				<p>Our mission is to offer our customers the highest quality cell phone products and services. We focus on personalized service to all customers by offering convenience and complete service. Additionally, have the technological expertise to assist customers in picking the product and service that best meets their needs. Our staff has strong vendor relationships with the product suppliers and will be able to meet customers' demand for the newest innovation in cellular phone technology.</p>

				<p>Divine Cell Care stocks and markets all reputed and leading brands of mobile telephones, related products and accessories. As part of the company’s policy to provide best quality products and ensure best customer care, we stock only models that are proved by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) of Sri Lanka.</p>

				<p>We directly import our stocks from authorized distributors from all over the world, thereby providing our loyal and satisfied customers with genuine and authentic products.</p>

				<p>Our product range covers all types and models of cellular phones, smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDA), tablet computers, authorized software applications for all cellular products and accessories of all types and reputed brands.</p>
